- 👋 Hi, I’m Tsuzas or Fernando, Portuguese
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Git, SQL, PowerBi, Python ( altough Python is on solid standby, felt like too much)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, willing to expand my repertoire.
- 📫 How to reach me, you can e-mail me anytime at F.pereira.2002@hotmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: started learning on 2024, still learning the ropes, but willing to do the job.
